##  Contribution Procedure

### Intro
In order to keep our repository clean, pretty, and consistent, we ask that you make contributions in a particular way. The repository has a simple structure-- besides the _main_ branch, each workshop has its own working branch, designated with a number and a one word descriptor for the workshop. 

Use of _main_ is reserved for major projects landmarks, such as the completion of work on a particular workshop. Workshop contributions should (almost) never be sent directly to _main_, but rather to the relevant project's branch.

We also ask that when making contributions, you fork the repository instead of attempting to commit directly to it. This goes a long way towards helping us achieve our goal of keeping this repo clean and organized.

### Making a Contribution
When making a contribution, please follow this procedure:

1. Fork the _projects2021_ repo and/or fetch changes from upstream to ensure that your fork is up to date.
2. Make changes as necessary in the relevant workshop branch. For example, if contributing to the soldering workshop, switch to _1-soldering_ on your fork and make changes on that branch.
3. Make a pull request to merge changes from your fork to the relevant branch on the main _projects2021_ repo.

### Example
If you want to get an idea of what this procedure might look like in action, you may refer to pull request ```psuieee/projects2021#6```, which merged this write-up into main from a fork.
